        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Angelica Lopez. I am currently a first-year undergraduate student at UCR. My major is currently undeclared CHASS. I own my own small business where I sell hand-crafted gifts and knick knacks, most of which are crocheted. For my business, I take on lots of roles, including advertising, creating products, and social media management. In these roles, I complete many tasks to create a platform for myself in which I attempt to cater to as many people as possible as a means of ensuring growth for my business. I hand make all of my products and then I incorporate photography skills to best capture the beauty of my creations to share online as a form of advertisement. In my small business, I practice customer service skills, as I communicate with consumers online to ensure they receive exactly what they are looking for and ensuring everything is completely to their taste, and eventually speaking with the customers in person when it comes time to deliver their orders. I hope to continue to grow my business further, and eventually hire more wonderful artists to share their amazing work. <br><br>
        Apart from owning a small business, I have part-taken in many volunteer opportunities. For instance, I participated in decorating a parade float for the Pasadena Rose Parade with my family, where we volunteered to clean up flowers and separate them into different viles to then place on a parade float for an organization called Elks. I was able to collaborate with other volunteers to contribute to a beautiful parade float covered in variou flowers, seeds, beans and more natural materials. I have also volunteered at my old middle school, Tomas Rivera Middle School, where I helped prepare band students for a parade. I currently have 7 years of experience in music, playing trumpet, so I thought I could contribute some of my own musical knowledge to those barely starting out. I was able to teach young musicians skills they hadn't yet been taught in class, as well as practice the skills they already had been preparing for their Christmas parade. I was able to help sharpen their marching form, playing skills and even their ability to do both at the same time. I wasn't physically gaining anything when helping these young individuals, but I really enjoyed being able to teach young minds new skills.<br><br>
        From a young age, I have also always enjoyed going to work with my father, who owns his own landscaping business. I do a lot of maunal labor when helping my father beautify the exterior of his clients' homes. I have learned lots of outdoor maintenance skills, worked with many natural materials and plants, and have perservered through hot climates during these times helping my father out. He has taught me at least one new skill each time I have worked his business with him and I continuously look forward to learning more. I have helped him with tasks including pulling weeds, trimming palm trees, changing sprinklers, digging out old tree trunks, mowing lawns, maintaining greenery and so much more. I feel these skills are something interesting to have and will be used later on in my own life. I would definitly be open to continuing in this type of labor either with my dad or anyone else in search of help with agricultural maintenance. I wouldn't mind volunteering for outdoor beautification in the future to make out world or community a better place.
